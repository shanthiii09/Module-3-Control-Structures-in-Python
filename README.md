# Module-3-Control-Structures-in-Python

In Task 1, we used a variable a to take an input value.
We then checked whether the number is divisible by 2 or not, to determine if the value is even or odd.
To check the condition, we used an if-else statement.

we have output as

Enter a number: 5
5 is an odd number.

Enter a number: 6
6 is an even number.

In Task 2, we used a variable a and set it equal to 0.
Using a for loop with the range (1, 51), we added every number in the range in order to find the total sum.

We have output as

The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is:1275
